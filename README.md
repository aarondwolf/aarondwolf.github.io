# Aaron Wolf's Github Page

I am a Pre-Doctoral Fellow in Economics at Yale University, conducting research in environmental and development economics.

I write Stata packages for use in common data cleaning workflows for field projects in development economics. These include integrations for SurveyCTO as well as general purpose algorithms.

I have also written multiple Stata schemes to provide a conhesive design set for Stata-generated visualizations for organizations I have/am worked/working for.

Check out my Github page at https://aarondwolf.github.io for links to Stata packages that are ready to install with net install. You are welcome to use any and all repositories for your own personal use, but the this page provides links to the packages that are relatively stable and ready for easy install.
